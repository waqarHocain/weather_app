# Weather App

A simple weather app, which displays the current weather. It fetch your location from your IP Address. So, if you're using a proxy, you may get inaccurate results.
 
I've used the following:
### Services
 - [Ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com)          // to get location of an IP Address
 - [Open Weather API](http://openweathermap.org)   // for getting weather information

### Libraries:
 - jQuery                      // for easy DOM manipulation
 - normalize                   // get rid of default browser styles
 - unGrid                      // extremely small css layout grid

### Fonts:                      
 - OpenSans
